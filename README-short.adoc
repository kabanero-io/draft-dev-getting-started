== What you will learn

This tutorial will give you an introduction to the developer experience, guiding you along the creation and deployment of a cloud-native
microservice.

At the end of this tutorial, you should have a good understanding of the
developer experience through the use of the https://appsody.dev[Appsody]
command-line interface. 

Youâ€™ll know how to create a new application and deploy it as 
a microservice on Kubernetes, having an appreciation for how the tooling 
does the heavy-lifting, helping you focus on the task of writing the code.

Note that the tutorial is based on a Node.js application using the 
https://expressjs.com/[Express] framework,  but the applications stacks
also include support for other programming languages and frameworks, and 
the platform supports the modular addition of support for other languages 
and frameworks through the creation of 
https://appsody.dev/docs/stacks/stacks-overview[application stacks].
