- Follow the instructions in the
link:docker-windows-aad[Special notes about Docker Desktop on Windows
10] to ensure your Docker installation can successfully write content to
volumes mounted into containers.
- https://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin], ensuring your Cygwin home directory *matches your Windows home directory*, as described in https://ryanharrison.co.uk/2015/12/01/cygwin-change-home-directory.html[this blog entry].

=== Enable Kubernetes 

Docker Desktop contains a standalone Kubernetes cluster for development purposes.
You will need to enable Kubernetes as this is disabled by default in Docker Desktop. 

[.tab_link.mac_link]
`*MAC*`

[.tab_link.windows_link]
`*WINDOWS*`

[.tab_content.mac_section]
Open the "Preferences" dialog, switch to the "Kubernetes" tab, and select the "Enable Kubernetes" 
option, as described in the 
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#kubernetes[Docker Destop for Mac] page.

[.tab_content.windows_section]
Open the "Settings" dialog, switch to the "Kubernetes" tab, and select the "Enable Kubernetes" 
option, as described in the 
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#kubernetes[Docker Destop for Windows] page.

=== Installing the Codewind Extension for Visual Studio Code

https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/[Eclipse Codewind] provides a set of extensions to IDEs for doing
cloud-native application development. They enable a full developer/debug
cycle with an incremental build where all the code is built and run
inside a container. This means that the likelihood of issues due to
different development, build and production environments is vastly
reduced.

Although Codewind is an Eclipse project, itâ€™s not limited to the Eclipse
IDE and in this tutorial, you will use Codewind inside Visual Studio
Code.

Codewind requires Docker, so before you begin, ensure your Docker
install is complete and running.

To install the "Codewind Extension" for "Visual Studio Code", you have
two options.

. Install using the *Install* button on
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.codewind[this
page].
. Manually launch Visual Studio Code, navigate to the *Extensions* view,
search for *Codewind*, and install the extension from here.

=== Sharing the Appsody Configuration between the CLI and Visual Studio Code - Optional

While this is optional, it is recommended. Rather than having *Appsody
CLI* projects stored separately to those you may create in an editor
such as *Visual Studio Code* or *Eclipse*, updating the *Appsody*
configuration file will enable you to work on your projects across both
the CLI and editor.

To share the Appsody configuration, follow the instructions at
https://github.com/eclipse/codewind-appsody-extension#optional-using-the-same-appsody-configuration-between-local-cli-and-codewind[this
repository].

=== Pre-requisite checks

This step will ensure your environment has all the prerequisites
installed and running.

(Windows users should execute it from a Cygwin shell) :

[source, role='command']
```
curl -sL https://github.com/gcharters/kabanero-dev-getting-started/releases/download/0.0.5/workshop-setup.sh | bash -s -- -p -l nodejs
```


=== Caching of large images

This step will ensure your environment has all the prerequisites
installed and running.

In addition to checking prerequisites, this step will also cache large
images into your local system. The cached content will save you valuable
time throughout the course of this tutorial.

(Windows users should execute it from a Cygwin shell) :

[source, role='command']
```
curl -sL https://github.com/gcharters/kabanero-dev-getting-started/releases/download/0.0.5/workshop-setup.sh | bash -s -- -c -l nodejs
```
