== What is Kabanero

Kabanero is an open source project that brings together other open source 
technologies into a framework for developing and deploying modern cloud-native 
applications.

That experience is based on project templates built atop curated runtime stacks,
which allows the rapid creation of new cloud-native applications that can be easily 
deployed to a Kubernetes environment without the need for specialized container or 
Kubernetes skills.
