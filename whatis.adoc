== What is the Kabanero project

The Kabanero project is an open-source project that brings together other open source  technologies into a framework for developing and deploying modern cloud-native applications.

That experience is based on project templates built atop curated application stacks, which allows the rapid creation of new cloud-native applications that can be deployed to a Kubernetes environment without the need for specialized container or Kubernetes skills.
